## Data Engineering and Machine Learning with Stanley Martin Homes 
#### *NYC Data Science Capstone Project*
#### Background
Stanley Martin Homes LLC, a nation-wide homebuilder established in 1966, is building a pricing analytics tool used by their Market Research and Sales teams to fortify and guide the pricing of homes they build.

Our data science team was to assist them in creating an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that incorporated: (1) data extraction from public multiple listing services (MLS), (2) data cleaning and storage on Azure cloud, and (3) Machine Learning predictions. The final deliverable was an easy-to-use interactive application for Stanley Martin's teams.
