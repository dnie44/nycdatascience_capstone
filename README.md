## Data Engineering and Machine Learning with Stanley Martin Homes 
#### *NYC Data Science Capstone Project*
#### Background
A large nation-wide homebuilder in operation for over 50 years approached our data science team to collaborate in creating a pricing analytics tool. Their research and sales teams needed a way to benchmark the prices of homes they build to the overall market.

Our team was to assist them in creating an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that incorporated: (1) data extraction from public multiple listing services (MLS), (2) data cleaning and storage on Azure cloud, and (3) Machine Learning predictions on both price and geographical desirability of houses. 

The final deliverable was an easy-to-use interactive application for the stakeholder's teams. A public version of the app is located [here](https://djnt-capstone.herokuapp.com/).

Overall, our work for the stakeholder proved to add value for the sales and pricing team by providing insights and accurate benchmarking. The tools we created will help a variety of teams in the following ways: 
* The price recommendation model will provide a price range based on user input, similar houses and geographical areas for the pricing team to use as a reference point
* The affordability index allows the sales team to understand different geographical areas and the cost of living in each area 
* The desirability index will allow the pricing and sales teams to understand where and why people want to live where they do and allow that information to help guide pricing decisions based on the price elasticity in each cluster 
* The data visualisation and school district breakdown allows for competitive analysis and opportunity identification from the sales team

The work done by our group will help the stakeholder in the above ways and can be expanded upon for further work. It is also an example of how Data Science can be used in the real estate industry to help optimize prices, understand similar geographical areas, and spot opportunities.
